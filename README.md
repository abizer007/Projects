1) Amazon.com - this is one of the firsts projects i took up using html,css and java script. It is a clone website for the real amazon website. It is build from scracth using no templete
   it is to improve my website building skills as well as to understand how the actual amazon website must have been built and the difficulties they must have faced.
2) Slot-machine - it is one of the first python projects that i took up it is a very simple las vegas kinda slot machine concept where you deposit certain amount and bet on stuff, the game calculates the balance after every bet and promtps the user to play further with whatever money they have left.
3) Perfect number - this is the most advance project i have taken on after being incspiered by my professor of have a program which code find and give first 100 perfect numbers i set out to make such a program. Now this is quit complex and goes beyond my scope of understanding so some of the logic as been taken from the internet. even after that i have written a code which in theory code get 100 perfect numbers but due to limted computing resourses it ran only up till the first 10 and then the computer could'nt process further.
4) Time Series - For a project in a course like "Statistical Methods," implementing time series forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet in R would be a practical and educational exercise. ARIMA focuses on traditional statistical methods for stationary data, while Prophet, developed by Facebook, offers a robust solution for non-stationary time series with irregularities like holidays. Both methods involve data preparation, model fitting, forecasting, and evaluation, providing valuable insights into forecasting techniques widely used in data analysis and decision-making scenarios.
5) Statistical methods - I have written R codes for my statistical methods course and it covered the following topics:
Statistical Methods Project in R
This repository contains R code for various statistical methods and analyses, implemented as part of a project for a "Statistical Methods" course. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what's included:
Basic Calculations: Simple arithmetic operations and statistical calculations.
Correlation Analysis: Implementing Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.
Linear Regression: Using linear models to analyze relationships between variables.
Data Visualization: Visualizing data using plots like scatter plots and line plots.
Matrix Operations: Performing operations on matrices, including determinant and symmetry checks.
Hypothesis Testing: Implementing tests such as Run test, Mann-Whitney U test, and parametric/non-parametric tests.
Probability Distributions: Implementing binomial and Poisson distributions.
Control Structures: Examples of if-else statements, loops (while and for), and functions.
Read CSV Data: Importing and analyzing data from CSV files.
GitHub Repository: This repository serves as a practical demonstration of applying statistical methods in R, suitable for educational purposes and understanding fundamental statistical concepts.
