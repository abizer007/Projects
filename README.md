1) Amazon.com - this is one of the firsts projects i took up using html,css and java script. It is a clone website for the real amazon website. It is build from scracth using no templete
   it is to improve my website building skills as well as to understand how the actual amazon website must have been built and the difficulties they must have faced.
2) Slot-machine - it is one of the first python projects that i took up it is a very simple las vegas kinda slot machine concept where you deposit certain amount and bet on stuff, the game calculates the balance after every bet and promtps the user to play further with whatever money they have left.
3) Perfect number - this is the most advance project i have taken on after being incspiered by my professor of have a program which code find and give first 100 perfect numbers i set out to make such a program. Now this is quit complex and goes beyond my scope of understanding so some of the logic as been taken from the internet. even after that i have written a code which in theory code get 100 perfect numbers but due to limted computing resourses it ran only up till the first 10 and then the computer could'nt process further.
